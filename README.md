Sharing power measurements done for various microcontrollers

This repo contains CircuitPython scripts and screenshots for analyzing the power consumption of various microcontroller boards in different scenarios using Nordic's Power Profiler Kit 2 (PPK2).

##  Measurement setup
- Nordic PPK2 set in source mode
- PPK2 VOUT set to 3.7V to mimic nominal lipo battery voltage
- PPK2 VOUT connected to battery input on the microcontroller board

## Boards
- Adafruit Feather nRF52840 Express
